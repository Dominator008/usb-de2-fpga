1. -=-=-=HARDWARE-=-=-=

The code is currently setup in loopback mode - meaning any bytes downloaded to the board will be echoed back, 
with the following line inside usb.vhd:

    drv_i.io <= drv_o.io;  --drv_x.io is of record type, with RDy and SData fields. 
    --when SData is ready, RDy will pulse for one clock cycle.

Directory structure:

src/ - source files for usb interface
	usb.vhd - top entity
	drv.vhd - usb driver
	hal.vhd - low level interface with ISP1362
	devreq.vhd - handles usb device requests 
	isp_inc.vhd - ISP1362 register constants and bitfields
    usb_inc.vhd - usb descriptors and configuration.
        For description of the fields: http://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb1.shtml
				
quartus/ - quartus project files. Quartus 11 and 12 were tested with this project
    usb.qpf - Quartus project file 
	Makefile - makefile for Gnu make - builds and loads the design

sim/ - ModelSim and Active HDL testbenches and simulation files

2. -=-=-=SOFTWARE-=-=-=

The software has been tested under Windows 7 SP1 x64.

On the PC side, The libusb-win32 open source project provides the software driver and
user application to interface with the DE2 board

The installer inside support/driver is autogenerated by the inf-wizard.exe, provided by the libusb-win32 project. 
After pointing Device Manager to the support/driver folder, the driver should install and a new device should appear
in device manager list, under libusb-win32 section:


support/driver/   - windows driver to be installed prior to using the user
                    application. 
                    just point to this directory when prompted to find
                    the driver for this device

support/winusb/  - User application based on libusb-win32 API implementing basic loop-back upload/download
                Files:
                    usb2/usb2.vcxproj - Visual Studio C++ 2010 project file
                    usb2/loopback_test.cpp - sends and receives bytes 
                            the value of last received byte is displayed on a row of
                            LEDs
