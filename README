1. -=-=-=HARDWARE-=-=-=

The code is currently setup in loopback mode - meaning any bytes downloaded to the board will be echoed back, 
with the following line inside usb.vhd:

    drv_i.io <= drv_o.io;  --drv_x.io is of record type, with RDy and SData fields. 
    --when SData is ready, RDy will pulse for one clock cycle.

Directory structure:

src/ - source files for usb interface
	usb.vhd - top entity
	drv.vhd - usb driver
	hal.vhd - low level interface with ISP1362
	devreq.vhd - handles usb device requests 
	isp_inc.vhd - ISP1362 register constants and bitfields
    	usb_inc.vhd - usb descriptors and configuration.
