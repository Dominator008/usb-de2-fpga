Compiles with Quartus 11 & 12 tools.\r\n\r\nFuture enhancements\r\n* Transfer rate:  ISP1362 supports speeds up to 1MBps - current design can only transfer 1-2 bytes per USB transaction, which translates to large USB protocol overhead and lower bandwidth.\r\n* Hardware flow control:  ISP1362 has built in flow control features to detect overflow/underflow conditions. Currently these conditions must be avoided by the host software application.","tagline":"Hardware interface for USB controller on DE2 FPGA Platform","google":"UA-17760683-2"}
