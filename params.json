{"name":"USB for DE2-FPGA in VHDL","body":"### \r\n\r\nA standalone (NIOS II free) interface in VHDL to the ISP1362 USB device for Altera DE2 Development board. \r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\nThe interface is designed to enable simple, fast, and reliable communication with DE2 board and replace UART interfaces and NIOS II based designs typically used for this task.\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n* Fmax: 420MHz -  limit due to max I/O toggle rate.\r\n* Area: 338 LEs.\r\n* 2 Bulk endpoints (IN/OUT)\r\n* Test host software application for Windows using [libusb-win32](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/libusb-win32/wiki)\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n* Transfer rate:  ISP1362 supports speeds up to 1MBps - current design is limited to a maximum of 2 bytes per USB transaction, which translates to large USB protocol overhead and lower overall bandwidth.\r\n* Hardware flow control:  ISP1362 has support for flow control features to detect overflow/underflow conditions. Currently these conditions must be avoided by the host software application.","tagline":"Hardware interface for ISP1362 USB controller on Altera DE2 FPGA Development Board ","note":"Don't delete this file!
