{"body":"### \r\n\r\nUsing only VHDL to develop a standalone (NIOS II free) interface to the ISP1362 USB device present on Altera DE2 Education board. \r\n###\r\nThe interface is designed to replace legacy uart connections that are used for interfacing with PC, and utilize a more reliable, faster, and versatile USB 2.0 connection.\r\n\r\nDesign achievements:\r\n* Maximum speed: FMAX of 420MHz -  limit due to minimum period restriction (max I/O toggle rate)\r\n* Low area: 339 LUTs (much lower than Nios-II implementation)\r\n* Extendibility: design is split in multiple files, to support adding more features if necessary.\r\n* Simple I/O interface:  8 bit data and one bit Ready signals incoming /outgoing data.\r\n\r\nDesign future work\r\n* Transfer rate:  USB interface supports speed up to 1MBps - current design only transfers 1 byte per USB transaction, which translates to large protocol overhead and lower transfer rates.\r\n","google":"","name":"USB DE2-FPGA VHDL ","note":"Don't delete this file!
