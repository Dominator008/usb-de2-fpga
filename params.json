{"name":"USB DE2-FPGA VHDL ","tagline":"Hardware interface for USB controller on DE2 FPGA Platform","body":"### \r\n\r\nUsing only VHDL to develop a standalone (NIOS II free) interface to the ISP1362 USB device present on Altera DE2 Education board. \r\n###\r\nThe interface is designed to replace legacy uart connections that are used for interfacing with PC, and utilize a more reliable, faster, and versatile USB 2.0 connection.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n* Maximum speed: FMAX of 420MHz -  limit due to minimum period restriction (max I/O toggle rate)\r\n* Low area: 339 LUTs (much lower than Nios-II implementation)\r\n* Extendibility: design is split in multiple files, to support adding more features if necessary.\r\n* Simple I/O interface:  8 bit data and one bit Ready signals incoming /outgoing data.\r\n\r\nFuture enhancements\r\n* Transfer rate:  USB interface supports speed up to 1MBps - current design only transfers 1 byte per USB transaction, which translates to large protocol overhead and lower transfer rates.\r\n* Hardware flow control:  ISP1362 has built in flow control features to detect overflow/underflow conditions. Currently these conditions must be avoided in host software application.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
